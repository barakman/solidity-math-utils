    @dev Consider a pool which implements the bonding-curve model over a primary reserve token and a secondary reserve token.
    Let 'on-chain price' denote the conversion rate between these tokens inside the pool (i.e., as determined by the pool).
    Let 'off-chain price' denote the conversion rate between these tokens outside the pool (i.e., as determined by the market).
    The arbitrage incentive is always to convert to the point where the on-chain price is equal to the off-chain price.
    We want this operation to also impact the primary reserve balance becoming equal to the primary reserve staked balance.
    In other words, we want the arbitrager to convert the difference between the reserve balance and the reserve staked balance.
    Hence we adjust the weights in order to create an arbitrage incentive which, when realized, will subsequently equalize the pool.
    
    Input:
    - Let t denote the primary reserve token staked balance
    - Let s denote the primary reserve token balance
    - Let r denote the secondary reserve token balance
    - Let q denote the numerator of the off-chain price
    - Let p denote the denominator of the off-chain price
    Where p primary tokens are equal to q secondary tokens
    
    Output:
    - Solve the equation x * (s / t) ^ x = (t / r) * (q / p)
    - Return x / (x + 1) as the weight of the primary reserve token
    - Return 1 / (x + 1) as the weight of the secondary reserve token
    
    If the rate-provider provides the rates for a common unit, for example:
    - P = 2 ==> 2 primary reserve tokens = 1 ether
    - Q = 3 ==> 3 secondary reserve tokens = 1 ether
    Then you can simply use p = P and q = Q
    
    If the rate-provider provides the rates for a single unit, for example:
    - P = 2 ==> 1 primary reserve token = 2 ethers
    - Q = 3 ==> 1 secondary reserve token = 3 ethers
    Then you can simply use p = Q and q = P
    
    @param t The primary reserve token staked balance
    @param s The primary reserve token balance
    @param r The secondary reserve token balance
    @param q The numerator of the off-chain price
    @param p The denominator of the off-chain price
    
    Note that `numerator / denominator` should represent the amount of secondary tokens equal to one primary token
    
    @return The weight of the primary reserve token and the weight of the secondary reserve token, both in ppm units
