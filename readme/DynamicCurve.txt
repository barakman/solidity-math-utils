**Conversion Formula:**
---

Consider a liquidity pool with two reserve tokens S and R of equal weights, where:

- $s=$ balance of token S
- $r=$ balance of token R

Converting an amount of S tokens into R tokens is based on $y=r\cdot\big(1−\frac{s}{s+x}\big)$, where:

- $x=$ input amount of token S
- $y=$ output amount of token R

The conversion formula for any type of weighted-pool is $y=r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{s+x}\big)^{w_1/w_2}\Big)$, where:

- $w_1=$ weight of token S
- $w_2=$ weight of token R

As you can see, when $w_1=w_2$, the latter formula reduces to the former formula.

**Calculating New Weights:**

Let F and G denote the primary reserve token and the secondary reserve token respectively.

Let 'on-chain price' denote the conversion rate between F and G inside the pool (i.e., as determined by the pool).

Let 'off-chain price' denote the conversion rate between F and G outside the pool (i.e., as determined by the market).

Let the following denote:

- $t=$ F staked balance of the pool
- $s=$ F reserve balance of the pool
- $r=$ G reserve balance of the pool
- $q=$ G/F off-chain price numerator
- $p=$ G/F off-chain price denominator

Where $1$ unit of F is equal to $q/p$ units of G (or $p$ units of F are equal to $q$ units of G).

First, note that the market’s arbitrage incentive is always to convert units of F to units of G or vice-versa, such that the on-chain price of F/G will become equal to the off-chain price of F/G.

Consider the case of $t>s$. Our goal is to set the weights of the pool, such that the arbitrage incentive of equalizing the on-chain price and the off-chain price will subsequently increase $s$ to become equal to $t$. In other words, we want the arbitrager to transfer $t−s$ units of F to the pool, in exchange for units of G.

Suppose that we’ve set the weights:
- $w_1=$ F reserve weight
- $w_2=$ G reserve weight

Then:

- A user converting $t−s$ units of F will get $r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{w_1/w_2}\Big)$ units of G
- F reserve balance after the arbitrage conversion will be $t$ of course
- G reserve balance after the arbitrage conversion will be $r-r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{w_1/w_2}\Big)$
- F/G on-chain price after the arbitrage conversion will be $\large\frac{t\cdot{w_2}/{w_1}}{r-r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{w_1/w_2}\Big)}$
- F/G off-chain price is of course $\frac{p}{q}$ (or $\frac{q}{p}$ if the inverse rates are provided)

When either $t$ or $p/q$ change, we want to recalculate $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that the arbitrage incentive of making the on-chain price equal to the off-chain price will be equivalent to converting $t−s$ units of F to units of G, thus increasing F reserve balance ($s$) to be equal to F staked balance ($t$).

In other words, we want to recalculate $w_1$ and $w_2$ such that $\large\frac{t\cdot{w_2}/{w_1}}{r-r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{w_1/w_2}\Big)}=\frac{p}{q}$.

Let $x$ denote $w_1/w_2$, then:

$\large\frac{t/x}{r-r\cdot\Big(1−\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{x}\Big)}=\frac{p}{q}\rightarrow$

$\large\frac{t/x}{r\cdot\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{x}}=\frac{p}{q}\rightarrow$

$\large{x}\cdot\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)^{x}=\frac{tq}{rp}\rightarrow$

$\large{x}=\frac{W\Big(\log\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)\cdot\frac{tq}{rp}\Big)}{log\big(\frac{s}{t}\big)}$, where W is the Lambert W Function.

After computing $x$, we can represent it as a quotient of integers, i.e., $x=a/b$.

Then, since $x=w_1/w_2$ and $w_2=1-w_1$, we can calculate:

- $\large{w_1}=\frac{x}{x+1}=\frac{a/b}{1+a/b}=\frac{a}{a+b}$
- $\large{w_2}=\frac{1}{x+1}=\frac{1}{1+a/b}=\frac{b}{a+b}$
