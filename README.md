## IntegralMath

This module implements the following interface:
- `function floorLog2(uint256 n)` => `(uint8)`
- `function floorSqrt(uint256 n)` => `(uint256)`
- `function ceilSqrt(uint256 n)` => `(uint256)`
- `function floorCbrt(uint256 n)` => `(uint256)`
- `function ceilCbrt(uint256 n)` => `(uint256)`
- `function roundDiv(uint256 n, uint256 d)` => `(uint256)`
- `function mulDivF(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 z)` => `(uint256)`
- `function mulDivC(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 z)` => `(uint256)`
- `function mulDivExF(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 z, uint256 w)` => `(uint256)`
- `function mulDivExC(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 z, uint256 w)` => `(uint256)`

Function `floorLog2(n)` computes the largest integer smaller than or equal to the binary logarithm of `n`.

Function `floorSqrt(n)` computes the largest integer smaller than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Function `ceilSqrt(n)` computes the smallest integer larger than or equal to the square root of `n`.

Function `floorCbrt(n)` computes the largest integer smaller than or equal to the cubic root of `n`.

Function `ceilCbrt(n)` computes the smallest integer larger than or equal to the cubic root of `n`.

Function `roundDiv(n, d)` computes the nearest integer to the quotient of `n` and `d` (or `n / d`).

Function `minFactor(x, y)` computes the smallest integer `z` such that `x * y / z <= 2 ^ 256 - 1`.

Function `mulDivF(x, y, z)` computes the largest integer smaller than or equal to `x * y / z`.

Function `mulDivC(x, y, z)` computes the smallest integer larger than or equal to `x * y / z`.

Function `mulDivExF(x, y, z, w)` computes the largest integer smaller than or equal to `(x * y) / (z * w)`.

Function `mulDivExC(x, y, z, w)` computes the smallest integer larger than or equal to `(x * y) / (z * w)`.

Note that function `mulDivF` and function `mulDivC` revert when the **actual** result is larger than 256 bits.

Note that function `mulDivExF` and function `mulDivExC` revert when the **actual** result is larger than 256 bits.

Note that function `floorSqrt` and function `ceilSqrt` are guaranteed to return the correct output for every input.

However, when compared with the **actual** square root, smaller input generally yields relatively lower accuracy of the output.

For example, `floorSqrt(3)` returns 1, but the actual square root of 3 is ~1.73, which yields a relative accuracy of only ~57%.

Note that function `floorCbrt` and function `ceilCbrt` are guaranteed to return the correct output for every input.

However, when compared with the **actual** cubic root, smaller input generally yields relatively lower accuracy of the output.

For example, `floorCbrt(7)` returns 1, but the actual cubic root of 7 is ~1.91, which yields a relative accuracy of only ~52%.

## FractionMath

This module implements the following interface:
- `function poweredRatio(uint256 n, uint256 d, uint256 exp, bool fast)` => `(uint256, uint256)`
- `function productRatio(uint256 xn, uint256 yn, uint256 xd, uint256 yd)` => `(uint256, uint256)`
- `function reducedRatio(uint256 n, uint256 d, uint256 max)` => `(uint256, uint256)`
- `function normalizedRatio(uint256 n, uint256 d, uint256 scale)` => `(uint256, uint256)`

### Powered Ratio

Function `poweredRatio` computes the power of a given ratio by a given exponent.

In order to avoid multiplication overflow, it may truncate the intermediate result on each iteration.

Subsequently, the larger the input exponent is, the lower the accuracy of the output is likely to be.

The input argument `fast` allows to opt for either performance (using `true`) or accuracy (using `false`).

This module defines a maximum exponent of 4 bits (i.e., 15), which can be customized to fit the system requirements.

### Product Ratio

Function `productRatio` computes the product of two ratios as a single ratio whose components are not larger than 256 bits.

If either one of the intermediate components is larger than 256 bits, then both of them are reduced based on the larger one.

### Reduced Ratio

Function `reducedRatio` computes the nearest ratio whose components (numerator and denominator) are not larger than the input threshold.

Note that function `reducedRatio` is not meant to replace GCD, nor does it strive to achieve better accuracy.

GCD is not being used here, because the time-complexity of this method depends on the bit-length of the input.

The worst case is when the two input valus are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, in the case of `uint256` - F369 and F370, which yield 367 iterations.

Moreover, the main issue with using GCD for reducing an arbitrary ratio, is the fact that it doesn't even guarantee the desired reduction to begin with.

Reducing an input ratio by its GCD in advance (at your own expense) can most certainly improve the output of function `reducedRatio` in terms of accuracy.

However, without knowing specific characteristics of that ratio (e.g., each one of its components is a multiple of `0x1000`), doing so is generally useless.

### Normalized Ratio

Function `normalizedRatio` computes the nearest ratio whose sum of components (numerator + denominator) equals the input scale.

Note that the output ratio can be larger than the input ratio in some cases, and smaller than the input ratio in other cases.

For example:
- `normalizedRatio(12, 34, 100)` returns `(26 74)`; the output ratio is smaller than the input ratio (26 / 74 = 0.351 < 0.352 = 12 / 34)
- `normalizedRatio(1234, 5678, 100)` returns `(18 82)`; the output ratio is larger than the input ratio (18 / 82 = 0.219 > 0.217 = 1234 / 5678)

Keep in mind that it is an important consideration to take when choosing to use this function.

For example, when designing a sustainable financial model, it is imperative to never entitle more than the actual entitlement.

The same consideration applies for all the other functions in this module.

## AnalyticMath

This module implements the following interface:
- `function pow(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c, uint256 d)` => `(uint256, uint256)`
- `function log(uint256 a, uint256 b)` => `(uint256, uint256)`
- `function exp(uint256 a, uint256 b)` => `(uint256, uint256)`

### Exponentiation

Function `pow(a, b, c, d)` approximates the power of `a / b` by `c / d`.

When `a >= b`, the output of this function is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the actual value of (a / b) ^ (c / d).

When `a <= b`, the output of this function is guaranteed to be larger than or equal to the actual value of (a / b) ^ (c / d).

### Natural Logarithm

Function `log(a, b)` approximates the natural logarithm of `a / b`.

The output of this function is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the actual value of log(a / b).

It does not support `a < b`, because it relies on unsigned-integer arithmetic, and the output for such input would be negative.

### Natural Exponentiation

Function `exp(a, b)` approximates the natural exponentiation of `a / b`.

The output of this function is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to the actual value of exp(a / b).

### Module Customization

This module can be customized to support different input ranges (as a tradeoff with accuracy and/or performance).

## AdvancedMath

This module implements the following interface:
- `function solve(uint256 a, uint256 b, uint256 c, uint256 d)` => `(uint256, uint256)`

### Equation Solving

## DynamicCurve

This module implements the following interface:
- `function equalize(uint256 t, uint256 s, uint256 r, uint256 q, uint256 p)` => `(uint256, uint256)`

### Equalization

Consider a pool which implements the bonding-curve model over a primary reserve token and a secondary reserve token.

Let 'on-chain price' denote the conversion rate between these tokens inside the pool (i.e., as determined by the pool).

Let 'off-chain price' denote the conversion rate between these tokens outside the pool (i.e., as determined by the market).

The arbitrage incentive is always to convert to the point where the on-chain price is equal to the off-chain price.

We want this operation to also impact the primary reserve balance becoming equal to the primary reserve staked balance.

In other words, we want the arbitrager to convert the difference between the reserve balance and the reserve staked balance.

Hence we adjust the weights in order to create an arbitrage incentive which, when realized, will subsequently equalize the pool.

Input:
- Let t denote the primary reserve token staked balance
- Let s denote the primary reserve token balance
- Let r denote the secondary reserve token balance
- Let q denote the numerator of the off-chain price
- Let p denote the denominator of the off-chain price

Where p primary tokens are equal to q secondary tokens

Output:
- Solve the equation x * (s / t) ^ x = (t / r) * (q / p)
- Return x / (x + 1) as the weight of the primary reserve token
- Return 1 / (x + 1) as the weight of the secondary reserve token

A detailed reasoning of this method can be found [here](readme/DynamicCurve.pdf).

If the rate-provider provides the rates for a common unit, for example:
- P = 2 ==> 2 primary reserve tokens = 1 ether
- Q = 3 ==> 3 secondary reserve tokens = 1 ether

Then you can simply use p = P and q = Q

If the rate-provider provides the rates for a single unit, for example:
- P = 2 ==> 1 primary reserve token = 2 ethers
- Q = 3 ==> 1 secondary reserve token = 3 ethers

Then you can simply use p = Q and q = P

The dynamic-curve method was conceived by [Bancor](https://github.com/bancorprotocol).
